      Hi, I'm Sunil! A passionate, self-taught web developer whose journey into
      the digital world began at a young age. Captivated by the endless possibilities
      of the web, Iâ€™ve armed myself with Angular and Spring Boot as my core tools.
      With these, I strive to craft meaningful applications and contribute something
      valuable to the world.
